.sce is used for parameter identification of the NXT motor.
Angular velocity of the motor is calculated by the number of revolution count obtained from the brick.
These values are extracted by running the client code (inside SPAM folder) on the Lego Mindstrom brick. 
The server code( inside src folder) is run from the system to initiate and control the DC motor.
